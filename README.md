# kubernetes_tutorial

Used VirtualBox to set up a Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop for the purposes of learning some kerbnetes. 

The first demo uses a prebuilt docker image and is just a deployment.  The second one has you create a node application, create a container (docker) for it, and deploy it.

Going forward, I would like to try creating a swagger/python docker image and a deployment for it.
